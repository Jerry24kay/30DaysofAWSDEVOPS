Welcome to Day 4 of my AWS DevOps Challenge! Today, I explored Elastic Beanstalk and Docker, and here's a snapshot of my journey:

Exploring Elastic Beanstalk: A New Adventure

Today, I ventured into Elastic Beanstalk, a tool that makes deploying applications easier. Why? Because I wanted to use Docker for my project. Docker containers are like magic boxes that can run applications smoothly, and I was excited to dive into this world.

Starting on My Local Machine: Where It All Begins

Before taking my project to the cloud, I started locally. I began working on a game called "2048" using Visual Studio Code. This game wasn't just lines of code; it was an opportunity to get creative and build something fun.

Crafting the Dockerfile: Building the Foundation

To get my game ready for deployment, I created a Dockerfile. This file is like a recipe for my application. It tells Docker how to set things up, like installing necessary tools and configuring Nginx (a web server). It felt like sculpting an environment where my game would come to life.

Building and Running the Docker Image: The Magic Unveiled

With the Dockerfile ready, I built a Docker image. It's like creating a virtual copy of my application. Seeing my image among the Docker images was like seeing my creation take its first steps.

Finally, when I launched the Docker container and played the game on my computer, it was pure magic. My code had transformed into an interactive game!

Going Beyond Code: Discovering the Joy

This day wasn't just about code and tech. It was about exploring, being creative, and experiencing the joy of building something from scratch.

Exploring Elastic Beanstalk: Taking It to the Cloud

With confidence, I moved to the AWS console and searched for "Elastic Beanstalk." There, I created a new application with ease. I chose Docker as the platform for my game.

Uploading My Creation: The Dockerfile

I uploaded the Dockerfile I created earlier. This file is like the heart and soul of my project. It held the power to turn my local game into a live, accessible application.

Choosing the Path: The Free Tier and Single Instance

Since I was on the AWS free tier, I opted for a single instance. It was a choice that matched my experimental spirit. In just a few clicks, I had my environment set up.

The Magic of Deployment

Then, it happened. My game was live! Anyone could access it through a URL provided by AWS. It felt like sharing a piece of art with the world.

On Day 4, I explored Elastic Beanstalk and Docker to deploy my "2048" game. Visual Studio Code helped me with coding, Docker containerized my project, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk made deployment effortless. Tomorrow, I'll continue this AWS DevOps journey, uncovering more of its capabilities! Stay tuned!
